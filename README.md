What's working-
1) Successful implementation of Swing component and overall GUI.
2) Answer is correct for years <= 2000.
3) Finding the correct Anchor day and other logic.

What isn't-
1) Logic for December month is not added.
2) I can't find the reason why the answer is wrong for years > 2000.
3) For some specific dates like leap year dates, it is sometimes correct and sometimes not.
